## HelpLeh! 

HelpLeh! is a one stop platform for volunteers and organisers of volunteer expeditions connect, to help the community in need. Through this application, potential volunteers will be able to find volunteering opportunities and sign up for them easily. On the other hand, volunteering organisations can use this application to find volunteers easily.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
